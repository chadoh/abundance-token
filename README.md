ðŸŒ³ Abundance Token
==================

Money might not grow on trees, but anyone can mint themselves this [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) token!

This contains contract code for an ERC20 token deployed to [Ethereum's Rinkeby test network](https://support.airswap.io/en/articles/2831385-what-is-rinkeby) which allows anyone to mint themselves however much they want. This is great for testing situations that require ERC20 tokens, such as [NEAR's Rainbow Bridge](https://github.com/near-examples/erc20-to-nep21).
